    <p>A 42-year-old Pakistani pilgrim survived after suffering five heart attacks during Hajj this year, thanks to swift and intensive medical care.
    <p>Amid extreme heat, several pilgrims faced health complications, with some tragically passing away. Among those affected was a Pakistani man who suffered multiple cardiac arrests while performing Hajj.</p>
    <p>According to APP, he was rushed to East Arafat Hospital in critical condition. The medical team managed to stabilize him, but due to the severity of his condition, he had to remain on a ventilator.</p>

    <p>For advanced treatment, he was airlifted to King Abdullah Medical City in Makkah, where doctors performed angioplasty to open his blocked arteries. To support blood circulation, a mechanical heart-assist device (Impella) was also implanted.</p>
    <p>After continued monitoring and treatment, the patientâ€™s condition began to improve. He was eventually discharged from the hospital on June 17, showing signs of recovery.</p>
    <p>This case highlights the life-saving role of emergency medical interventions during the physically demanding Hajj pilgrimage, especially under harsh climatic conditions.</p>

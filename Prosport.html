    <h1>Pakistan’s Trio March Into Knockouts at Asian 6-Red Snooker Championship</h1>
    <img src="smocker.avif" alt="">
    <p>Pakistan’s snooker stars continued to impress at the ongoing Asian 6-Red and Team Snooker Championship, with all three national cueists advancing to the pre-quarterfinals after strong performances in the group stage.</p>
    Awaisullah Munir, Mohammad Asif, and Mohammad Sajjad are leading the country in Sri Lanka
    <p>The biggest highlight came from defending champion Awaisullah, who finished unbeaten in his group despite facing a stiff challenge in his final group match against India’s Pushpender Singh. But the Pakistani cueist showed composure under pressure to seal a 4-2 victory. Singh had made an early statement by taking the first frame but Awaisullah hit back. Though Singh levelled the match at 2-2, Awaisullah stayed focused to win the last two frames and top his group.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Mohammad Asif, the most experienced of the trio with multiple international titles to his name, had a mixed day but still did enough to qualify. He cruised past Oman’s Abdullah Al Raisi 4-0 in his opening match, but his second match was a nail-biter against Sri Lanka’s Irshath Thaha. Despite a strong start, Asif lost momentum and eventually fell short 4-3 in a match that saw both players trade frame-winning breaks. Asif’s earlier wins, however, secured his spot in the knockout stages</p>
    <p>Completing Pakistan’s perfect qualification run was Mohammad Sajjad, who dominated his match against Sri Lanka’s Badurdeen Musarra with a clean 4-0 victory. Sajjad was in control from the first frame, barely giving his opponent any room. He struck a notable 58 break in the third frame and wrapped up the match with ease.</p>
    <p>The results mean Pakistan will have all three players in the last 16, a promising sign for the country’s campaign in the Asian 6-Red Snooker Championship, which takes place until June 28.</p>

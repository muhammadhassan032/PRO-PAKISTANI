    <h1>Female Teachers Yet to Receive Free Electric Scooters</h1>
    <img src="Electric-Scooties-for-Female-Teachers.jpg.avif" alt="">
    <p>The promise to provide scooters to thousands of female teachers remains unfulfilled, as no funds have been allocated for the initiative in the 2025â€“26 fiscal budget. The School Education Department had previously announced plans to distribute scooters to women educators across the province.</p>

    <p>Despite a public commitment made by the provincial education minister to provide scooters to both school and college teachers, the recent budget failed to earmark any funds for this purpose. As a result, many female teachers have expressed disappointment and frustration.</p>
    <p>They urged the education minister to follow through on the promise, stating that access to scooters would significantly ease their daily commute and help ensure timely arrival at schools.</p>

    <h1>Free Vehicle Emission Testing Suddenly Stopped</h1>
    <img src="smoke-emitting-vehicles-in-lahore.jpg.avif" alt="">
    <p>The Punjab government has announced that all Emissions Testing System (ETS) booths across Lahore will remain closed today due to continuous rainfall.
   <p>According to officials, ETS booths operate in open areas, and the decision was made to ensure the safety of both ETS teams and the public. Citizens have been advised to avoid visiting ETS booths today and may call 1373 for further information.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz recently approved an extension of the free emissions testing deadline. Initially scheduled to end on June 30, the free service will now continue until August 31, 2025, allowing more citizens to benefit.</p>
    <p>Earlier, Secretary of the Environment Protection and Climate Change Department Raja Jahangir Anwar had announced that the free ETS service would be replaced by paid emissions testing at authorized private vehicle dealerships across Lahore. Under that plan, motorists would be required to pay Rs. 400 per test. </p>
    <p>However, the extension allows citizens additional time to take advantage of the free service before the transition takes place. The move is part of the provincial governmentâ€™s ongoing efforts to reduce pollution and ensure cleaner air in Lahore.
